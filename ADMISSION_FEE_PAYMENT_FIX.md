# Admission Fee Payment Display Fix

## Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: "Already Paid This Month" Bug
**Problem**: When student paid only admission fee (LKR 5,000) but NOT monthly class fee, the system incorrectly showed "Already Paid This Month" for the class.

**Root Cause**: The `hasPaymentThisMonth` check was counting ALL payments including admission fee payments when determining if monthly class fee was paid.

**Fix**: Updated payment check logic to EXCLUDE admission fee payments:
```javascript
// BEFORE: Counted all payments
const hasPaymentThisMonth = (payments || []).some(p => {
  return paymentMonth === currentMonth && 
         Number(paymentClassId) === Number(enr.classId) &&
         (p.status === 'paid' || p.status === 'completed');
});

// AFTER: Only counts CLASS payments, excludes admission fee
const hasPaymentThisMonth = (payments || []).some(p => {
  const paymentType = p.payment_type || p.paymentType || 'class_payment';
  
  return paymentMonth === currentMonth && 
         Number(paymentClassId) === Number(enr.classId) &&
         (p.status === 'paid' || p.status === 'completed') &&
         paymentType !== 'admission_fee'; // EXCLUDE admission fee
});
```

### Issue 2: Payment History Not Showing Payment Type
**Problem**: Payment history in cashier dashboard showed "LKR 5000.00" without mentioning it's an admission fee payment.

**Fix**: Updated payment display to show payment type clearly:
- Admission Fee: "Admission Fee (Class Name)" or "Admission Fee"
- Class Payment: "Class Name"

```javascript
// Added payment type detection and display logic
const paymentType = p.payment_type || p.paymentType || 'class_payment';
const isAdmissionFee = paymentType === 'admission_fee';
const className = p.class_name || p.className || '';

let displayLabel = '';
if (isAdmissionFee) {
  displayLabel = className ? `Admission Fee (${className})` : 'Admission Fee';
} else {
  displayLabel = className || p.description || 'Class Payment';
}
```

**File**: `frontend/src/pages/dashboard/cashierDashboard/CashierDashboard.jsx` (Line ~4204)

### Issue 3: Student Dashboard Not Showing Admission Fee Payments
**Problem**: Admission fee payment (LKR 5,000) was not appearing in student's "My Payments" page.

**Fixes Applied**:

#### Backend Fix:
Updated SQL query to include `payment_type` field:
```php
// BEFORE: Missing payment_type
SELECT 
    fr.transaction_id,
    fr.date,
    fr.class_name,
    fr.amount,
    fr.payment_method,
    fr.status,
    fr.reference_number,
    fr.user_id,
    fr.class_id
FROM financial_records fr

// AFTER: Includes payment_type
SELECT 
    fr.transaction_id,
    fr.date,
    fr.class_name,
    fr.amount,
    fr.payment_method,
    fr.status,
    fr.reference_number,
    fr.user_id,
    fr.class_id,
    fr.payment_type  -- ADDED
FROM financial_records fr
```

**File**: `backend/payment-backend/src/PaymentController.php` (Line ~495)

#### Frontend Fix:
Updated payment mapping to display admission fee labels:
```javascript
const paymentType = p.payment_type || p.paymentType || 'class_payment';
const isAdmissionFee = paymentType === 'admission_fee';

let displayClassName = '';
if (isAdmissionFee) {
  // Show "Admission Fee - Class Name"
  const baseName = p.class_name || p.className || '';
  displayClassName = baseName ? `Admission Fee - ${baseName}` : 'Admission Fee';
} else {
  // Show class name
  displayClassName = p.class_name || p.className || '';
}
```
