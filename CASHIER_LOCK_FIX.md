# Cashier Dashboard Lock State Fix

## Problem
After locking the cashier dashboard session, refreshing the browser window would automatically unlock the dashboard and show the cashier dashboard without requiring password authentication.

## Root Cause
The `isLocked` state was initialized using React's `useState(false)` without any persistence mechanism:

```jsx
const [isLocked, setIsLocked] = useState(false);
```

When the page was refreshed, the React component would re-mount and the state would be reinitialized to `false`, effectively unlocking the dashboard automatically. This was a **security vulnerability** as it bypassed the lock mechanism.

## Solution
Implemented state persistence using `sessionStorage` to maintain the lock state across page refreshes within the same browser session.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Initialize Lock State from sessionStorage (Line 3151-3156)
```jsx
// Initialize lock state from sessionStorage (persists during browser session, but cleared when tab is closed)
const [isLocked, setIsLocked] = useState(() => {
  const savedLockState = sessionStorage.getItem('cashier_locked');
  return savedLockState === 'true';
});
```

#### 2. Persist Lock State When Locking (Line 3480)
```jsx
const handleLockToggle = () => {
  if (isLocked) {
    // If locked, show unlock modal
    setShowUnlockModal(true);
  } else {
    // If unlocked, lock immediately
    setIsLocked(true);
    sessionStorage.setItem('cashier_locked', 'true'); // Persist to sessionStorage
  }
};
```

#### 3. Clear Lock State When Unlocking (Line 3486)
```jsx
const handleUnlock = () => {
  setIsLocked(false);
  sessionStorage.setItem('cashier_locked', 'false'); // Clear from sessionStorage
  setShowUnlockModal(false);
  // Focus back to scan input after unlocking
  setTimeout(() => {
    focusBackToScan();
  }, 100);
};
```

#### 4. Show Unlock Modal on Mount if Locked (Line 3199-3203)
```jsx
// Show unlock modal on mount if the session was locked
useEffect(() => {
  if (isLocked) {
    setShowUnlockModal(true);
  }
}, []); // Run only once on mount
```

## Why sessionStorage?
- **Persists across page refreshes** during the same browser session
- **Automatically cleared** when the browser tab/window is closed
- **Session-specific**: Each tab has its own sessionStorage, providing better security
- **Better than localStorage**: localStorage would persist even after closing the browser, which could lead to confusion

## Security Benefits
✅ Lock state now survives page refreshes
✅ Cashier must enter password to unlock after refresh
✅ Lock state is cleared when browser tab is closed (fresh start)
✅ Each browser tab maintains its own lock state independently

## Testing
1. Lock the cashier dashboard (F1 key or Lock button)
2. Refresh the page (F5 or Ctrl+R)
3. Verify that:
   - Dashboard remains locked (blurred)
   - Unlock modal automatically appears
   - Password is required to unlock
4. Close and reopen the browser tab
5. Verify that the lock state is cleared (starts unlocked)
